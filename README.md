JSON Definition Masher

Joins several objects defined in json files into a single json schema file.

## Usage

1. Create a folder with the schema name inside the 'schemas' folder
2. Put all your json examples in that folder (all variations of the same object)
3. Run the program. `npm start`

It will merge all the variations into a single object and give you the schema.

TODO: Detect atributes present in all variations and mark them as required.
